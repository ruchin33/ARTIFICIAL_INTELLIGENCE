# Artificial_Intelligence_Inference_engine
An ultra optimized inference engine for first order logic using the resolution algorithm
The code takes care of everything i.e from parsing the first order logic,creating the knowledge base,
unification and everything else that is needed to create an ultra optimized inference engine.
